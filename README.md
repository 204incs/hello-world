My Name is Brad Lockwood. I am currently a PM working with Clubessential. I want to learn more about coding as I want to move into an RnD/Data Migration PM role, which is why I want to take the data track. I have been married to my wife Katie for 3 years, and we are in the process of trying to get a new house that will let us start a family. I also have a 4-year-old dog named Dood.
