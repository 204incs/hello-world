My Name is Brad Lockwood. I am currently a PM working with Clubessential. I am wnting to learn more about coding as I want to move into a RnD/Data Migration PM role which is why I want to take the data track. I am married to my wife Katie for 3 years and we are in the process of trying to get a new house that will let us start a family. I also have a 4 year old dog named Dood.
